# Project Working Steps

## After connecting template engines

1.  First make sure that mongo db connected
2.  Next step is we need to create a database schema in model
    a. open usermodel
    b. design the db schema (which includes field names of table and data type)
    ex: user -> fieldname = data type
    name = string
    email = string
    mobile = string
    age = number
    you can continue the fields depend on requirement
    now we will consider only these 4 fields
